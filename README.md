# Lithium-ion-Battery-Analysis
Problem Statement : Lithium Battery Degradation
The aim of this project is to analyze the degradation of Lithium-ion Batteries during their charging cycles. We will be trying to build a model to accurately predict the change in SEI (Solid Electrolyte Interphase) Layer in the batteries and to study their impact in various important parameters of the battery such as SOH (State of Health), SOC (State of Charge).
